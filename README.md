# Indeed_JobFinder


In order to Install the Application 
1. Install the requirements.txt file
2. Setup the database connection in settings.py and views.py (define your connector) 
3. Run the project by using python manage.py runserver

This project will fetch the details about Data Science Jobs from Indeed Site and then store it in the database 
Through the local host you can check the data 


Python Schedule Function has been used and which executes on intervals and hits the API which accordingly hits the 
Job Portals like indeed in this case and details like JobTitle ,Company and the salary is fetched and stored into the database 
further, Pagination concept is implemented in order to bring the data into from database to local host


Thanks
